Ask Copilot to write the readme.md.
Ask Copilot to comment the code.

## Explain

If you want to understand the behavior of the code or how it works, ask for an explanation.

## Language Translation

Convert from one language to another.

Both programming language transalation - Fortran to C++, Javascript to Python ...  try COBOL.
And text files - English to French, German etc.

## Rename suggestions

## Arithmetic functions

- Add, substract, multiply, divide

Note how after Add - it suggests you probably want other arithmetic functions  

## Animal classes

Animal class  
Dog class, Cat class  
Make Sound

## Game

I want to develop a game for web (html,css,javascript) that resembles Pathagon . It is a board of 8 x 8 . players take in turns to place a counter (red or blue) on the board.
Players take turns placing a counter on any available cell of the board.
Any placed counter must be removed from the board if it is surrounded on its two immediate adjacent sides by their opponentâ€™s counter. So this check must be made every time a counter is placed.
The winner is the first to create an unbroken path connecting their two opposite sides of the board.

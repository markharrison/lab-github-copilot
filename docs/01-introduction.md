# GitHub Copilot

Hands-on Lab Script

2 March 2024

![alttext](images/lab-copilot.jpg)

## Introduction

GitHub Copilot is your AI pair programmer.  It uses OpenAI Codex to suggest code and entire functions in real-time, from within the editor.

Trained on billions of lines of code, GitHub Copilot turns natural language prompts into coding suggestions across dozens of languages.

## Notes

When following this lab, be aware that Copilot is probabilistic, not deterministic.  The used LLMs are sophisticated probability engines, so you might not get the same results for the exact same prompts every time.

## Introduction

GitHub Copilot is your AI coding assistant - helping you write code faster, stay in flow, and focus on what matters. Powered by cutting-edge AI models from OpenAI, Microsoft, and other providers, Copilot offers real-time code suggestions, explanations, and even whole solutions across your development workflow.

You can use GitHub Copilot :

- Directly in your IDE (like Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, and Neovim) for inline suggestions and completions

- In GitHub Copilot Chat, where you can ask questions, debug, explain code, or generate unit tests in natural language

- Within GitHub.com, helping with pull requests, documentation, and code reviews

Trained on vast amounts of public code, documentation, and natural language, Copilot understands context and conventions â€” letting you code more confidently across dozens of programming languages and frameworks.

## Notes

When following this lab, be aware that Copilot is probabilistic, not deterministic.  The used LLMs are sophisticated probability engines, so you might not get the same results for the exact same prompts every time.
